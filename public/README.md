# BackboneJS BoilerPlate with Marionette

Needed a boilerplate for a project at my company couldnt find a good one so decided to create one.

# Give credit where credit is due.
I am using thomas davis's standard backbone boilerplate with require js as a start. 

You can find the original boilerplate here
