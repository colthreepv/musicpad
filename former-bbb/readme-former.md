Backbone Boilerplate
====================

This boilerplate is the product of much research and frustration.  Existing
boilerplates freely modify Backbone core, lack a build process, and are very
prescriptive; Backbone Boilerplate changes that.

Organize your application with a logical file structure, develop your
Models/Collections/Views/Routers inside modules, and build knowing you have
efficient code that will not bottleneck your users.

## Getting started ##

The easiest way to get started is to install Git and clone the repository:

``` bash
# Create a new project directory and enter it.
mkdir myproject && cd myproject

# Using Git, fetch only the last few commits.  You don't need the full history
# for your project.
git clone --q --depth 0 git@github.com:tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate.git .
```

## Documentation ##

View the Backbone Boilerplate documentation here:

[GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate/wiki)

## Build process ##

To use the new and improved build process, please visit the 
[grunt-bbb](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb)
plugin repo and follow the instructions to install.  Basing your project off
this repo will allow the `bbb` commands to work out-of-the-box.
